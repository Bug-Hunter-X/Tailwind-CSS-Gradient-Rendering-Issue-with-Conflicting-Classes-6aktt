```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes.  However, if the `...` contains conflicting or poorly-ordered classes related to background colors or sizes, the gradient may not render correctly, or may be unexpectedly overridden.
