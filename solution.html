```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
</div>
```
The solution involves removing or modifying any conflicting classes.  In this case, unnecessary or contradictory background color classes might be the culprit.  The `p-4` and `rounded-lg` classes are added for visual clarity, but the core issue is removing conflicting styles.
